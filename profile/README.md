# CompSoc Edinburgh

CompSoc Edinburgh is Scotland's largest technology society focused on bringing together a diverse set of students interested in tech!

We hold events such as monthly tech talks from industry and academia, weekly socials, balls, and more. We also finance and run sub-societies (called Special Interest Groups) that run various events themselves, such as SIGINT running the annual PwnEd CTF, TypeSig running the annual TUPLE conference, QuantSIG participating in Kaggle competitions and more. 
For more information, check out https://comp-soc.com.

This GitHub organisation houses the repositories that CompSoc either directly or indirectly maintains, including website frontends, backends, bots, scripts, and service configs. If you have newly become a committee member, please contact your Technical Secretary to gain access to view private repositories!
If you are a SIG member (e.g. a representative or the tech person) and you would like access, please also contact the TechSec. SIGs and committee members are free to create repositories within our organisation for services, like HackTheBurgh's website or PwnEd's website.
